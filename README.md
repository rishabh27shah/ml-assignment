## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (v1.21.0+)
- Docker (17.03+)
- Operator-sdk (v1.4.0+)
- Kubectl (v1.11.3+)
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.11.3+)

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Check CRDs:**

```sh
kubectl get crd
```

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mailersend:tag
```

**Default image name:** controller:latest

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mailersend:tag
```

**To deploy the CRD with image:**
We have the file for [deployment file](./CRD-deployment.yaml) in which we can update the configuration and image name.

```sh
kubectl apply -f CRD-deployment.yaml
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

**To run in Development mode:**
Using this it will genrate manifest files, formating, installting and running CRD in development mode and we can see the logs.

```sh
make run
```

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
